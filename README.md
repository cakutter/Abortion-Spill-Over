# **To which extent the American abortion debate had a spillover on the French and German abortion discourse?**

## **I - Introduction**

### Context

   The polarizing revocation of Roe vs. Wade, which granted the right to abortion to American women, is particularly incoherent and almost absurd in a country so fervent about freedom of any kind as the US. In fact, the highest court in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court, on Friday, June 24, 2022, revoked its landmark "Roe vs. Wade'' decision, which recognized abortion as a constitutionally protected right. However, the news broke earlier on the 2nd of May 2022 through the leak of the report announcing the intent of the U.S. Supreme Court. This key date will serve as the anchor for our analysis. The revocation of Roe v. Wade implies that this right is now within the jurisdiction of the states. Thus, states that criminalize abortion have the option of voting respectively for the criminalization they associate with abortion and towards women who visit abortion clinics, as well as the identity of doctors performing abortions.
 
The media impact of the reversal of Roe v. Wade has been unprecedented around the world. The overturning of this 1973 legal decision signals a real setback for freedom in the United States. Over the years, Roe v. Wade and abortion rights have come under attack in the United States. One example is the law that went into effect in September of last year in Texas. The law prohibits abortion, even in cases of rape or incest once a fetus' heartbeat can be felt at about six weeks of pregnancy. At this point, most women do not know they are pregnant. The federal government asked the Supreme Court to block the legislation, which the court refused in December of last year. 

### Question

   At the heart of our analysis lies a much larger question concerning the influence of American soft power, which conveys opinions that, through their media reach, create controversies that are generally dispersed in the rest of the world, and in the case of our analysis, in France and Germany in particular. As such, the question we will ask in this paper is to which extent the American abortion debate had a spillover on the French and German abortion discourse.  

### Hypothesis

  If our analysis is far from having the pretension of leading to a prediction or anticipation of the distinction between the latent societal issues in European countries, which are only exacerbated by their debate in the United States, and those that actually arise due to the controversies they generate in the country of Uncle Sam, we have nevertheless the possibility of observing this phenomenon as objectively as possible. 

Since the political context in Germany already revolved around the question of abortion at the time, regardless of the nearly simultaneous overturning of Roe vs Wade, we assume that the German press was eventually more prone to an exacerbation rather than an interference of the US media coverage on the same subject, if any. 
On the contrary, we foresee a pre-eminence of the impact of the overturning of Roe vs Wadeon French media coverage. Indeed, the absence of contextual reasons at the time to explain the renewed interest and media coverage of abortion in France implies a greater American influence echoing in the French public and opinion. 

### Annonce de plan/Methodology

To proceed with our attempt to arrive at elements of an answer to this problem, we have chosen to use two distinct methods of analysis. We have chosen to carry out a comparative analysis before and after the revocation of Roe vs. Wade ruling on June 24, 2022 in order to possibly observe an increase or not of mentions of the abortion theme and the corpus associated.
The first analysis we conducted is based on the collection of articles from a variety of newspapers spanning the spectrum of editorial lines in France and Germany referring to abortion via Factiva.
The second analysis we conducted is based on the collection of tweets mentioning abortion without mentioning the United States.

## **II - Choice of Countries & Methodology**

### 1. Choice of Countries 

  We decided to concentrate our analysis on the specific case of the French and German press. This choice was made for very pragmatic reasons of understanding the language in which we collected our databases. In addition, our respective knowledge of the editorial lines of the different newspapers in these countries allows us a more precise criticism of their bias. 
 
##### FRANCE

The choice of France is particularly interesting in view of the burning news that marks the recent first step towards the inscription of the right to abortion in our Constitution. On Wednesday, November 9, the deputies validated a constitutional law proposal in this sense, to protect themselves against possible challenges like those observed in the United States.  The short text adopted on Wednesday, carried by the leader of the Renaissance deputies, Aurore Bergé, must now be examined in the hemicycle during the week of November 28.
 
##### GERMANY

The case of Germany is equally fascinating because of the repeal by the German Parliament on June 24, 2022, of a legislative provision that restricted publicity and information on abortion and had led to the conviction of several gynecologists. This decision, which runs counter to the direction taken by the United States, allows us to highlight an underlying influence of American measures on the policies of European countries, which, if we may generalize as a premise for our analyses, is correlated positively or negatively with societal debates that may or may not be latent.

### 2. Time periods 

  As we want to study the spillover effect of the American abortion debate onto the European abortion debate, we will define two time periods  for our analysis. As a cut-off date, we use May 2nd 2022, the day on which a report leaked that Roe vs Wade would be overruled by the Supreme Court. We then define two time periods of three months: (1) PRE Roe vs Wade, from February until April 2022, and (2) POST Roe vs Wade, from May until August 2022. From then on, we will look at the effect of the American abortion debate on the European one, using a method similar to the difference-in-difference method from econometrics, with the control group being the country before Roe vs Wade, and the treatment group the same country after Roe vs Wade.

### 3. Data collection 

### 3.1. Newspaper

First, we will focus on how newspapers have been treating the abortion debate in France and Germany during the PRE and POST time periods. We are using Factiva to download newspapers from both countries.

##### FRENCH NEWSPAPERS

For this analysis, we decided to focus on eleven of the most read French newspapers. Considering the fact that most newspapers are slightly biased towards certain political views, we tried to cover all possible political opinions within the country. The newspaper we chose to download on Factiva are as follows: 

![imagenet logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74500362/209145454-ab1d9be7-23dd-467f-9f63-32cc6f28de71.png)

As such, one third of these readers read newspapers slightly oriented towards the left, one third reads liberal newspapers, then, 460K people read proximity newspapers and 350K read newspapers from the right wing. The choice of the newspapers is thus balanced enough to allow a fair representation of the population.

We then proceeded to download all articles from these newspapers mentioning the word “avortement” *(French for abortion)*. We ended up having 134 articles for the PRE period, and 232 articles for the POST period. Unfortunately, we couldn’t access articles from *Le Monde* and *Libération*, but still gathered a significant amount of articles from other newspapers, especially from *Ouest France* and *Le Figaro*. Here is the repartition of articles in the PRE and POST period by newspaper:

![imagenet logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74500362/209146375-c95d389d-f260-4154-b9ff-4292d77abaa0.png)
*Amount of articles mentioning “avortement” by French newspaper in he PRE and POST period*

##### GERMAN NEWSPAPERS

Regarding German newspapers, there weren’t enough articles available on Factiva from the biggest newspapers to yield a high enough count of articles. As such, we decided to download all available articles from German newspapers during these two time periods, and have 235 articles for the first time period, and 458 for the second one.

For the PRE time period, we have articles from a total of 106 newspapers, mostly local newspapers, with no newspaper exceeding 8 articles in that time period with the Keyword “Abtreibung”. For the POST time period, we have a total of 139 newspapers, with a maximum of 20 articles for one newspaper.

![imagenet logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74500362/209146571-84d67b81-ae64-4930-80f6-8f29b0ad1fa7.png)
*Top 20 Newspapers with highest amount of articles in our dataset in the PRE period*

![imagenet logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74500362/209146886-a0dea961-d856-4a67-8cb3-c60ca3ca9688.png)
*Top 20 Newspapers with highest amount of articles in our dataset in the POST period*

From our lists, the first thing we can see is that local newspapers, such as *Schwarzwälder Bote*, *Stuttgarter Zeitung*, *Berliner Zeitung* or *Trierischer Volksfreund*, are highly represented in our corpus. Second, bigger German newspapers such as *Süddeutsche Zeitung*, *Welt online*, *Spiegel Online* or *Die Zeit*, didn’t publish more articles on abortion than other local newspapers. As a reminder here: Germany is a federal state that is less centralized than France, which is reflected by a higher diversity of local newspapers than in France. Still, there are various question that arise: what proportion of the their total amount of articles are dedicated to the topic of abortion? And is there a difference in this proportion between smaller and bigger newspapers? How do local and bigger newspaper treat the topic of abortion? A deeper qualitative analysis of the articles’ content in the next section will allows us to better grasp the way the newspaper talk about abortion.

An important limitation to mention here: while downloading the dataset, we have only searched for the keyword "Abtreibung" *(abortion in German)*. Nevertheless, there is a second word for abortion in German, which is used more in a medical context: "Schwangerschaftsabbruch" *(interruption of pregnancy)*. We have decided to use only the keyword "Abtreibung", as this is the one citizens would normally use.

### 3.2. Tweets

 As an additional layer to the analysis we have also looked at the broader public discourse, by examining the change in the discussion on twitter in Germany as well as France. For this we used Minet to download tweets mentioning the keyword *avortement* or *Abtreibung* in french or respectively german. We then semi-manually filtered these tweets for location, by constructing a list of most frequently used locations and manually assigning the corresponding country, thus coming up with a dictionary. This dictionary was used to then limit the corpus to 22.278 tweets from France and 9.002 tweets from Germany used to conduct further analysis.

## **III - Media Analysis**
 
### Quantitative analysis of the spillover effect

  The hypothesis of our paper is that the overruling of Roe vs Wade by the American supreme court has generated an artificial debate about abortion in Europe. First, we want to quantify this spillover effect. To do so, we make the assumption that if an article mentions both the keywords “US” and “abortion”, we consider that the debate is centered around the American abortion debate (right circle on the chart below). Otherwise, if the article only mentions the keyword “abortion”, we consider the debate is a national one (left circle). Our hypothesis is that the group of articles mentioning only abortion and not the US (left circle) is increasing the post period, due to an artificial spillover effect from the American abortion debate to the European abortion debate.




*France*
  First thing to notice, is that we have 232 articles for the POST period, compared to 134 in the PRE period, which implies a 132% increase between the two time periods in France. From the PRE time period, 7 articles out of 134 articles mention “États-Unis”, which represents 5% of the articles. From the POST time period, 79 out of 232 articles mention “États-Unis”, which account for 30% of the articles. Not only did the amount of articles about abortion increase in the POST period, but also the proportion of articles mentioning the US and abortion. As such, in the POST period, both circles from the chart have increased, even though the right circle mentioning the US and abortion has increased more than proportionally. As such, this data confirms our original hypothesis - looking at quantitative data, it seems that there has been an artificial spillover effect in France.

 *Germany*
  In Germany we notice a similar pattern with a 197% increase in the amount of articles between the PRE and POST period. What is more, 84 out of 235 mention the keywords “USA” and “Abtreibung” in the PRE time period, which means that 36% of the articles talk both about the US and abortion and thus belong to the right circle. For the POST time period, this number is 58%. Here again, as with the French articles, there seems to be a spillover effect, as the absolute number of articles mentioning abortion without mentioning the US is increasing.

*Comparison France-Germany*
  The first observation is that Germany has more than one third of its articles mentioning abortion and the US simultaneously in the PRE period. How come that Germany was already talking about the US and abortion before Roe vs Wade? The qualitative analysis will help us dive deeper into this, and in particular look at how different topics connect between each other during each time period. The second observation is that in the second time period, Germany has a bigger proportion of posts mentioning abortion and the US than France. As such, it seems that the spillover effect was higher in France than in Germany. On the other hand, we need to explore which topics exactly monopolized the national debates, which we will do in the next part of the analysis.

As a first mention of limitation about this part: This method is quite primitive, as it only takes into account two single keywords that can be used together in differing contexts, and only draws on a limited number of articles from specific newspapers. For example, we could have used further keywords, such as “américains” in France, or more specific keywords like “Roe vs Wade”. 


### Qualitative evolution of topics across time - A comparison between before and after Roe vs Wade

  To broaden our understanding of the spillover effect we will now qualitatively evaluate our data, to identify specific topics. We will first look at the abortion debate in France, both in the PRE and POST period, and then do the same for Germany.

#### France - PRE Roe vs Wade 
 
##### Most used n-grams and their evolution over time


First, we look at the most used terms in the PRE time period, to understand what topics are most talked about. An unexpected finding here is that Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron are by far the most mentioned n-grams, both being mentioned over 100 times across the 134 articles. What is more, we can already identify two broad topics: the French presidential elections, and topics related to women’s rights at large (droit des femmes, Simone Veil, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing).


We are now looking at the evolution of these most used n-grams over time, which allows us to connect the articles to important events in French society. The axis on the top is a timeline,  from the beginning of February until the end of April, and in this time period we can spot two main topics: around the beginning of March France celebrated international women’s day, and around the end of April, France witnessed presidential elections. Around international women’s day, women’s right (droit des femmes) is the most used n-gramm, while articles remember historic figures and events that have improved women’s right, such as Simone Veil or her famous “proposition de loi” to make abortion legal. Regarding the second time period, especially the name of the two run-off candidates Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron are increasingly mentioned, while other n-grams related to the elections such as “premier tour”, “premier ministre” or “élections présidentielles” also appear. 

Newspaper extract from l’Humanité, mentioning Marine Le Pen as a threat to the right to abortion, end of April 2022

Other n-grams that appear are “planning familial”, being mainly mentioned in the newspaper Ouest France as part of an invitation for citizens to get support and not hesitate to reach out to this organization. Finally, there is one n-gramm related to the US: Shar Dubey. Shar Dubey is an American businesswoman and CEO of dating apps like Match.com, and has stood up for the right of women to abort, in particular raising funds for Texan women willing to abort, after Texas restricted the access to abortion.

## Topic Network

After looking at the evolution of individual n-grams and making assumptions about how they relate to specific events in French politics and society, we will now try to understand how these n-grams relate to each other through a network analysis, and see whether specific newspapers focus on specific topics.

Topic Network from French newspapers articles in the PRE time period

The network of topics mentioned our French dataset for the PRE period give a new image of how French newspapers talk about abortion. On the network, we can spot one big cluster (blue in the middle), as well as four other smaller clusters (in the red circles). The big blue cluster includes a lot of topics both around international women’s day (“journée internationale des droits”, “luttes féministes”) and the French presidential elections (“deux candidats”), all clustered around the main n-gramm of “accès à l’avortement”. Despite being two distinct events in French politics and society, the topics discussed overlap. 

Two close clusters to the blue one are the smaller green and yellow ones (both circled in red). It looks like the green cluster is centered around left-wing politicians and topics, while the yellow cluster is rather centered on right-wing/liberal topics. The green left-wing cluster is then connected to the orange cluster at the top right, which talks about Shar Dubey and “match group” of which she is the CEO. “Rencontres en ligne” is a description of what the match group offers. Finally, the cluster on the bottom left composed of the red and orange clusters centers around the topic of French culture, mentioning cinema and literature.

To conclude, one can say that the abortion debate in the PRE Roe vs Wade time period was mainly centered around national events, namely international women’s day and remembering historic figures and progress regarding women’s rights, as well as the French presidential debate, with very limited mention of the US.

#### France - POST Roe vs Wade
 
##### Most used n-grams and their evolution over time

  We are now looking at the most frequent n-grams in the time period POST Roe vs Wade, and the first striking thing we notice is that “Cour suprême” is the most frequent n-gram in French articles, closely followed by “Cour suprême des États-Unis”. Overall, these n-grams suggest a drastic impact of the American events in the French press. Nevertheless, we also spot France specific topics that might correspond to the artificial spillover effect described earlier. As a matter of fact, “avortement dans la constitution” is now a new n-gram compared to the PRE period, and directly links to the proposal to include the right to abortion into the French constitution, that started to be discussed more thoroughly as a consequence of the overrule of Roe vs Wade. Finally, the mention of the European Union could be linked to the fact that during the French presidency of the European Union in the first half of 2022, French president Macron suggested to include abortion in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.

The list also mentions Paula Rego, a British-Portuguese feminist artist who passed away at the beginning of June, and who was a major advocate for abortion rights in the 1990’s and 2000’s. After Portugal voted against abortion rights in a referendum in 1998, she drew illustrations about clandestine abortions, which had a major impact in Portuguese society, and led to abortion finally being legalized in 2007.

  Again, we have a timeline at the top that goes from May 1st 2022 to July 31st 2022. From the beginning of May (time of the leak) onwards we can see that the supreme court continuously plays an important role in the topics, with a spike around mid of June, when Roe vs Wade got overruled. From this chart, it looks like there was no real spillover effect, as the US are still at the center of the abortion debate. Nevertheless, when digging a little further into the articles, one can see that most of them also related the US event to French politics and society as in the extract below, where the American abortion debate sparked a debate about European abortion rules in the 27 EU member states.
  
  
  Illustration of the spillover effect - Topic of the article: how the overrule of Roe vs Wade has sparked a debate abortion as a fundamental right within the EU27

Also, “planning familial” and “droit des femmes” might be more France specific. The planning familial in particular is a French association promoting women’s rights and providing sexuality education and counseling. In the article extract below, the French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne visited the Planning familial, where she held a speech about preserving fundamental women’s rights, such as abortion, as a reaction to the overrule of Roe vs Wade.


Illustration of the an article including the “Planning familial”

## Topic Network

*Topic Network from French newspapers articles in the POST time period*

When looking at networks of the topics at hand, we can identify three main clusters. Very interesting is the fact that the US is not at the center of the network, and only fills the orange cluster at the bottom right (circled in red). The two clusters on the left (dark red and lighter red) circled in red correspond to concepts or ideals such as constitutional rights and fundamental liberties, rather linked to French debates. The third cluster (blue and green at the top right) correspond to more tangible French socio-political and cultural topics, centered first around the planning familial, and mentioning for example Gisèle Halimi, a famous French lawyer that defended the right to abort fifty years ago. At the top left, a theater play by Michel Fau with the actress Catherine Frot is mentioned. This play called “Lorsque l’enfant paraît" talks about abortion. 

#### Germany - PRE Roe vs Wade 
 
##### Most used n-grams and their evolution over time

 Most used n-grams in German articles in the PRE time period

  In the German case, the most mentioned n-gram revolves around paragraph 219a, which is a paragraph in German penal law that prohibited doctors from informing patients about their abortion services. Kristina Hänel, whose name appears 30 times in our corpus, is a German gynecologist who was fined for advertising abortion procedures on her website. She appealed and finally triggered the elimination (“Abschaffung” or “Streichung” in the list of n-grams) of paragraph 219a from German penal law. The catholic church is also mentioned a lot, mainly in combination with articles about the abolition of paragraph 291a (such as in the extract below). Weirdly enough, almost as many Germans are protestant as catholic, but there is no mention of the protestant church. Annie Ernaux is also mentioned as part of the paragraph 219a debate, after the publication in Germany of a movie after her autobiographical book “L’événement”, that has also been commented on by Katrina Hänel. As a conclusion, it seems that the German national debate about abortion was centered around the abolition of the paragraph 219a, drawing on the opinion of personalities such as Katrina Hänel, or the one of the catholic church.
 
 
 Extract from the Mitteldeutsche Zeitung mentioning that the catholic church considers the abolition of Paragraph 219a “superfluous”
 
 *Evolution of most used n-grams in the PRE time period*

  When looking at the evolution of the most frequent n-grams from the German PRE articles corpus over time, we notice a high representation of articles about paragraph 219a from the beginning of February onwards. On February 19th 2022, the German Bundestag voted to allow the modification of the paragraph. Around end of April (on the right of the chart), a lot of articles mention Sandra Schmitz, a German woman who aborted and who made the buzz by publicly talking about her abortion . As our corpus is mainly drawn from regional newspapers, it makes sense to have anecdotal stories included. Here again, as in France, we can see that the topics at stake are closely linked to political and societal events that occur nationally. There is no mention of the US for now, almost like in France where the only link to the US was Shar Dubey, the CEO of match.com who spoke up about Texan’s abortion laws.

## Topic Network

 *Topic Network from German newspapers articles in the PRE time period*

	In terms of how the topics relate to each other, we can identify three clusters. The massive cluster in green at the top right is centered around paragraph 219a. This bubble connects to a lighter green one, that mentions women’s rights at large. At the left in orange and at the bottom in blue, we have two bubbles related to the catholic church. The orange one is more focused on Southern Germany, while the blue one is from the region around North Rhine Westphalia. The bubble in light yellow at the bottom left mentions various topics related to abortion. Overall, these topics clusters reflect German political events, and there is no mention of the US for now.

#### Germany - POST Roe vs Wade

##### Most used n-grams and their evolution over time

*Most used n-grams in German articles in the POST time period*

  In the POST time period, as for France, the most mentioned n-gram relates to the US (Supreme Court, Oberster Gerichtshof, New York). Second, there is now a new topic closely related: the G7 summit in Schloss Elmau at the end of June 2022, where Olaf Scholz gave his opinion on the overrule of Roe vs Wade. Third, Paragraph 219a still plays an important role and lastly, there is one new item around the figure of Alice Schwarzer, a German feminist journalist, who is famous for having designed the front page of Der Spiegel on June 6th 1971, with a title saying “We aborted” to raise awareness about abortion.
  
  
  On this graph we can clearly see the impact of the leak from the supreme Court, as there is a spike of articles mentioning the US Supreme court on the left (coinciding with the date of the leak), then less mentions of it and around June, which coincides with the dates in which the Supreme Court overruled Roe vs Wade. Parallel to this, we still see Paragraph 219a, and interestingly, Schloss Elmau is mentioned again around the date of the G7 summit. Thus, one can say that there is a spillover effect in that Scholz felt obliged to re-discuss abortion during the G7 summit in Schloss Elmau, but otherwise, there isn’t a new German national topic surrounding abortion.

## Topic Network

*Topic Network from German newspapers articles in the POST time period*

  In the POST time period, we can clearly identify two clusters that are identified by the topic of “unterschiedliche Methoden der Abtreibung” (= different methods of abortion). These two sides are thus barely linked. The side on the bottom right is centered around the US and around the G7 summit in Schloss Elmau. The side on the left is really Germany specific, with the double cluster centering around paragraph 219a again, and the small circle being around feminists like Alice Schwarzer reclaiming women’s rights. 
  
  
## **V - Discussion & Limitations**   

### Choice of not including other countries

  We originally intended to extend the spectrum of our analysis to the Republic of Ireland, Austria and Spain or Italy. Indeed, the respective histories of these countries in terms of criminalizing and/or embedding the right to abortion in their constitutions would allow us to obtain a broader diversity of perspectives. We have not been able to test these approaches due to the scope of our analysis and the relatively significant difference in observations of their databases. 

### Look at how different newspaper treat different topics

  However, the following limitations, we encountered as we deepenned our research, further justify our deliberate choice of not including additional countries to our analysis as comparison points. In fact, in order to acknowledge and stem to the utmost the intrinsic subjectivity that emanates from the various editorial lines of the newspapers we have decided to consider in our analysis, we could have conducted a parallel study comparing the degree of coverage and the overall position of these newspapers on the abortion topic versus other topics to account for the biases they might already entail. 

### Limited amount of newspapers used, not necessarily representative of the opinion of media

  Limiting our analysis to France and Germany also allowed us to not exacerbate the biased selection of newspapers offered by Factiva. Indeed, although quite broad, the arbitrary selection alters the representation of the opinion of the media. Indeed, stretching our analysis to the extreme of the spectrum of media coverage specially on the topic of abortion would have already improved the objectivity or at least highlight the greater disparities between the point of views on the subject.

### Limitations of Twitter

  We were confronted with a similar setback regarding the suitability of Twitter as a social media to reflect the opinion of the French and German population on the abortion debate. Indeed, the users of the platform, and consequently their tweets, entails various biases such as the age of the population, their interests, their sex or their actual participation in discussions. Indeed, although we have assumed that the opinions of Twitter users can be quite diverse, we remain also aware that not only do not all individuals using the platform tweet, but that the most extreme and polemical statements tend to go "viral" and thus reach a larger audience within the social network.  


## **VI - Conclusion**

### Overall findings for the analysis of newspapers

  An overall finding is that newspapers tightly reflect national political events and societal discussions. Articles are written according to events, whether local, regional, national or even international. In both cases, the preliminary quantitative analysis has revealed that there is a spillover effect, and that this spillover effect was especially strong in France. 

### Conclusion about French newspapers

  The qualitative analysis of French newspapers has revealed that in the period before Roe vs Wade, the national abortion debate was mainly centered about the women’s right day beginning of March and the presidential elections mid- to end of April. There is only one mention of the US around the CEO of match.com who openly denounced Texan abortion laws. After Roe vs Wade, there is a spillover effect through two channels: first, as President Emmanuel Macron was taking the presidency of the European Union, he suggested including the right to abortion into the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, as a reaction to Roe vs Wade. Second, we see a significant increase in mentions of the planning familial, a very France specific association informing and supporting French citizens with sexuality information and advice.

### Conclusion about German newspapers

  Regarding German newspapers, topics most discussed in the PRE Roe vs Wade time period are the paragraph 219a, as well as the closely linked topics of the opinion of the catholic church and Kristina Hänel, the gynecologist who led to the elimination of the paragraph 219a from the German penal code. As anticipated through the quantitative analysis, the spillover effect was less important in Germany than in France. German national topics barely changed, still centered around paragraph 219a, while the media still talked a lot about both the decision of the Supreme Court and the meeting of the G7 group at Schloss Elmau, where Scholz commented on the Supreme’s Court overruling of Roe vs Wade.
